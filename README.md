# Elixir Bme680

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lucaong/elixir_bme680.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lucaong/elixir_bme680) [![Hex Version](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/elixir_bme680.svg)](https://hex.pm/packages/elixir_bme680) [![docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-hexpm-blue.svg)](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir_bme680/)

An Elixir library to interface with the BME680 environmental sensor. The BME680
provides measurements of temperature, pressure, humidity, and gas resistance
(which is a proxy of indoor air quality).

## Installation

The package can be installed
by adding `elixir_bme680` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:elixir_bme680, "~> 0.1.4"}
  ]
end
```

The Linux I2C driver needs to be installed for this library to work (e.g.
`libi2c-dev` on Debian). If using [Nerves](https://nerves-project.org), the
driver should already be installed by default.


## Usage

```elixir
{:ok, pid} = Bme680.start_link()
# This default setting has been tested on the [Pimoroni BME680](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/bme680-breakout)
# The [Adafruit BME680](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3660) requires using a different i2c address.
# For the Adafruit, pass in the i2c_address option with value `0x77` as follows
# Bme680.start_link(i2c_address: 0x77)

measurement = Bme680.measure(pid)

# Measurement is like:
#
#   %Bme680.Measurement{
#     temperature: 21.74,
#     pressure: 1090.52,
#     humidity: 45.32,
#     gas_resistance: 10235
#   }
#
# Where temperature is in degrees Celsius, pressure in hPa, humidity in %
# relative humidity, and gas_resistance in Ohm
```

For more information, read the [API documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir_bme680).

### Note on gas resistance sensor warm up

Note that, due to the nature of the sensor, the gas resistance measurement needs
a warm-up in order to give stable measurements. One possible strategy is to
perform continuous meaurements in a loop until the value stabilizes (e.g.
changing by less than 1% between consecutive measurements). That might take from
a few seconds to several minutes (or more when the sensor is brand new), so it's
adviseable to perform the measurement asynchronously to avoid blocking.
